ESP-CUSTOM-KIT features the following integrated components:

* ESP32-S3 module
* 0.96" 80*160 LCD screen
* Joypad board module

Its another distinguishing feature is the embedded CP210x chip - an advanced multi-interface USB bridge. This chip enables to use JTAG for direct debugging of ESP32 through the USB interface without a separate JTAG debugger. ESP-CUSTOM-KIT makes development convenient, easy, and cost-effective.

Most of the ESP32 I/O pins are broken out to the boardâ€™s pin headers for easy access.
